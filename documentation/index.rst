Panoptes - eyes on your data
============================

Panoptes is a web application for exploration and visualisation of
data. Many of the features, such as querying and browsing tables, are
generic and can be used with any kind of data. However, there are
currently also some specialised features for genomic and geospatial
data.

Panoptes is a new project and in an early phase of development. For
more information about the project please contact Paul Vauterin
<paul.vauterin@gmail.com>, Ben Jeffery <ben.jeffery@gmail.com> or
Alistair Miles <alimanfoo@googlemail.com> or send an email to the
public mailing list <panoptes-dev@googlegroups.com>.
