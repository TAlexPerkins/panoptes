Roadmap: 1.0 release
====================

The 1.0 release is a major release. The following features are in scope.


Linking tables
--------------

In scope for this release is a set of features around linking tables
via foreign key relationships.

Extend the YAML configuration language for a data table to enable
specification of a foreign key relatonship to another data table.

In the data table UI, when viewing a table with a link to another
table, the values in the column which contains the foreign key values
become hyperlinks. Clicking on the hyperlink raises a popup containing
information about the linked entity in the other table.
